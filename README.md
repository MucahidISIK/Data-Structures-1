This project's goal is reading a file and saving as much as space we can with using doubly linked list.

After reading file and getting all the words in it we transfer the words to a doubly linked list. While transfering the words program detects the same words and avoids the repetition of the same words. Also program holds the data of how much space it saved then in the end of the process it shows the amount of space it saved.
